    <h1> Where does the Web come from? </h1>
    <h2> The Static Web – Web 1.0 </h2>
    <img src="apple-lisa.jpg" alt="Apple lisa">
    <p> Web 1.0 is often described as the “read-only” Web. <br> 
        It was characterized by static web pages with very limited user interaction.<br> 
        Most websites served as online brochures or repositories of information, where users could view content but could not easily contribute or modify it.<br>

        This early stage of the Web was dominated by institutional and corporate websites that provided information but offered little opportunity for collaboration or participation.
